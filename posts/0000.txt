  That sure is one dark way to open up a blog, that was originally meant to only cover lighthearted topics surrounding programming, sysadmin stuff and computing in general.\
But, that said, I feel obliged to highlight that I am by no means a pessimist or a "doomer". Quite the opposite, in fact - if I were to describe my view on this world in "conputer" metaphors, I'd say my software is **optimism**, wrapped around a huge suite of TDD tests and an entire coherent CI/CD pipeline with infrastructure backups set up in case of any and all disasters possible, all together known as **realism**.
